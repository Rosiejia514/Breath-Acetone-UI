# Breath-Acetone-UI
This project is a Real-Time Breath Acetone Analysis Tool, built using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib. It simulates real-time breath acetone levels and CO2 concentrations, displays the data, and warns when acetone levels are too high or when no breath is detected for a specified duration.
